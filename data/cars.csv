So my wife is selling her 2008 Nissan Altima 2.5S Sedan 4D. She is the second owner and purchased this car when she was a student in Southern California. The previous owner was from San Diego, had it for 3 years, and took very good care of it. The car was mostly in driven Southern California (only last year in the slightly wetter Bay Area).\\The car is in very good condition, has a clean title and very low mileage – only 60k miles (she doesn’t drive much). It has been well maintained. We almost always go to local Nissan dealers for maintenance and have a full record of maintenance history. The most recent multi-point check report from San Jose Nissan dealer is attached, which shows most of the components are in excellent condition. The only small problem is the vehicle information display under the speedo is not working. This display only shows stuff like outside temperature and does not affect the driving experience.\The tires are new – only 10k miles on them.\\We would like to sell the car as is. Obviously, it needs a Washington license and the title needs to transfer from California to Washington.\\The car has the standard package as a 2008 Nissan Altima 2.5S Sedan 4D, including:\•	4-Cyl, 2.5 Liter\•	Automatic, CVT\•	FWD\•	ABS (4-Wheel)\•	Power Steering, Tilt Wheel\•	AM/FM Stereo\•	CD/MP3 (Single Disc)\•	Keyless Entry\•	Air Conditioning\•	Power Windows\•	Power Door Locks\•	Cruise Control\•	Dual Air Bags\•	Side Air Bags\•	F&R Head Curtain Air Bags\•	Steel Wheels    "

If you are looking to drive for Uber/Lift on the side, you will be interested to know that he drove this car for Uber as recently as December. The car has a rear video camera, and a touch screen system. \\I drove the Prius recently from San Diego to Seattle with no issues, often averaging around 50 MPG. A few weeks after I arrived in Seattle the car lost power when I parked even though I had been driving for more than an hour. A jump start resolved the issue, but it happened again a couple of times. I discovered the root cause - a water leak in the rear, directly leaking water onto an aftermarket 12 volt battery. \\Well, $1400 later, the leak has been fixed and a new OEM 12 volt battery installed. The car is running great now. I also paid a Toyota for a 154 point Buyer's Inspection that you can find in the documentation below. The inspection came out clean. There are  a couple of items they recommend including new spark plugs and a brake fluid flush.\\This Prius is in great shape. It's an amazing fuel efficient vehicle. This is a great deal for reliable transportation that is also ride share ready. \\Here is a lot of documentation from the dealer.

It has been nothing but wonderful to drive. I purchased it at 69k miles back in 2016 and it is currently sitting at 83,400. It is my daily driver so expect the mileage to vary a little. I have modified the vehicle slightly. I added dual cone intakes, a new charge pipe and blow off valve. Cosmetically, I have installed a front and rear spoiler and brand new TSW wheels with PilotSuperSports. The wheels have one been on the car for less than 2k miles. I recently had the car serviced and there is no mechanical issues at all. I have an extended warranty active until April 16th if this year. I am not selling you a lemon, this car drives beautifully. Over the years I have had the Oil Pan replaced, power steering pump replaced and some other smaller things. I have all of the receipts of everything done to the car. For peace of mind, you can take the car to any mechanic and have it inspected. I will take care of any problems with my extended warranty. There are some paint chips on the front of the car and a small scratch on the bottom of the right side skirt due to the wonderful driveways of Mill Creek. CARFAX reports my car at a $10,080 value through private party. Want the car sold by the end of the month before I have to re-register it.

This BMW 535i is an exceptional drive with amazing handling and an impressive twin turbo engine.  I've babied this vehicle and parked it in the garage at work and home.  This is the only 10 year old BMW 535i with only 54,000 miles.  All other cars of similar specs are being sold with over 100,000 and show their wear and tear.  Not this one.  In my opinion, looks like it came out of the showroom yesterday.\\The 5-Series models are athletic and surefooted sport sedans that offer a surprising level of comfort inside. Technology features are also a strong point in the 5-Series, with performance and safety standouts like Active Steering, Active Roll Stabilization and a night vision system.   Sound, navigation systems are great and seat comfort is also fine.\\I purchased this car for one and only one reason - point to point drives from Seattle to Vancouver, BC every 2nd weekend so that I can visit family in Canada.  My two hour drive feels better than first class on Singapore Airlines.  The 6 cylinder drive is so smooth with little to no road noise (in my opinion)\\Before I get to the specs, let me share a CarFax Vehicle report for this car produced December 25, 2018.  Click here:\\https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjyoAoVSH61ko9V7Ugay8X_kCdCHPg\\OK, now with the details\\- Engine: 3.0L I6 F DOHC 24V\- Transmission: Automatic, 6-speed OD Steptronic\- Drive train: Rear Wheel Drive\- Braking: Traction Control, ABS, Dynamic Stability Control\- Steering: Power Steering, Tilt & Telescoping Wheel\- Entertainment: Bluetooth Wireless, CD/MP3, Sirius Satellite\- Comfort: Power Windows, Cruise Control, Air Conditioning \- Security: Anti-Theft, Keyless Entry, Power Door Locks\- Seats: Dual Power Seats; Leather\- Color: Midnight Metallic Black\- Title: CLEAN\\Here's some helpful history of the car\\1.  Only 54,000 miles (approximately 5K miles driven per year!)\2.  I'm the 3rd owner to be graced with this car\3.  The condition is excellent : No corrosion/rust and it has been driven/registered in CA & WA only\4.  I've got all the maintenance records; meticulously documented and collected from previous owners\\Here's where it gets better.  This is NO base model.  The included packages and options are insane!  They include:\\- Premium package\- Sports package\- Navigation options\\Details on each package are shown below\\PREMIUM PACKAGE\------------------------------\- Universal Garage Door Opener\- Auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors\- Auto-dimming rearview mirror\- Ambient light package Sport suspension \- Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) \\SPORTS PACKAGE \----------------------------\- Sports leather steering wheel \- Space-saver spare \- Shadowline trim \- Multi-Contour seats \- 18"" Light-alloy wheels \- Star Spoke with mixed performance run-flat tires\- Sport automatic transmission with shift paddles \\ADD ON FEATURES\-------------------------\- Navigation system \- iPod and USB adapter\- Fog Lights\\Why am I selling?  I have a new obligation requiring daily driving from the east side to Seattle so like many, I've bitten the HYBRID bug and want a gas performing vehicle.  I'm talking Prius or the equivalent people!  Yes, it's a downgrade but I haven't the need for 2 luxury vehicles in the same family.  So my loss is your gain.\\This gem of a vehicle is offered to all Craigslist readers for the fair price of:\\$11,800\\That is precisely in the middle of its Kelly Blue Book value.  In fact, this car is priced approximately $1,200 below the high end of the private party value range for the condition of this car.\\See the Kelly Blue Book Calculation here\https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjyoAoVSH61ko9V8_9MwDnP50s4N3g\\What's been added, changed, or fixed?  Everything :)  It's no secret, the BMW forums report oil leaks from the oil filter housing gaskets.  Mine wasn't serious but I took care of it right away.  Why?  I get my car serviced from a BMW master mechanic who suggested the recommendations and avoid larger problems if/when they happened.  This was recently fixed in March for the sum of $1,500.  While I was at it, I also had the (a) drive belt/tensioner and (b) front crank seal replaced.  Of course, had the classic oil changes as well.\\Before my time, the following was done:\1. Window tinting\2. Performance Times ($1,004)\3. Brake Fluid Service ($746)\4. Brake Front/Rear ($1,115)\5. Fuel Pump and Sensor Replacement ($5,44)\\...with records to show.\\I'm not in a huge rush to sell this car.  I love it and with summer coming, this could be my year of US-to-Canada luxury drive experiences.  But if it sells, I'm a step closer to satisfying my objectives steering me to a Prius (or equivalent).  \\In my opinion, this is an awesome car with a great ride.  You could pay significantly more for a modern 2018/19 version.  Why?  Or you could get a 2009 with over 100,000 miles.  Really?  Sit in both and experience the difference.  With approximately 54,000 miles, you're in a territory of no other.\\TERMS: Cashiers Check only.  Demos on weekends only.

It can go up to 20 miles on electric power alone (that varies with conditions). The charging cord is included and plugs into a standard electrical outlet.

Has never given me any problems in the 2 years that I've had it. Lowwww mileage, which was a huge selling point for me. When I purchased it, it had a little over 49,000 miles on it. Now it reads just under 55,000. It gets about 27 mpg in the city, but when we've taken it on road trips we find it gets about 30. \\2 brand new tires bought in January. I can buy the other 2 and keep the asking price, or leave that to you and knock off $500. \Also in January, I replaced both inner and outer tie rod ends, installed a new strut, and had an oil change.\Like I said, it really has been a great car to zoom around in the city with and has taken us on several long road trips. I would love to keep it, but it's just not in the cards for us at this point. \If you are interested and would like to meet in person, we can find a time that works for you to come check it out.\"
