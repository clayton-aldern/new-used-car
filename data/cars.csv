If you are looking to drive for Uber/Lift on the side, you will be interested to know that he drove this car for Uber as recently as December. The car has a rear video camera, and a touch screen system. \\I drove the Prius recently from San Diego to Seattle with no issues, often averaging around 50 MPG. A few weeks after I arrived in Seattle the car lost power when I parked even though I had been driving for more than an hour. A jump start resolved the issue, but it happened again a couple of times. I discovered the root cause - a water leak in the rear, directly leaking water onto an aftermarket 12 volt battery. \\Well, $1400 later, the leak has been fixed and a new OEM 12 volt battery installed. The car is running great now. I also paid a Toyota for a 154 point Buyer's Inspection that you can find in the documentation below. The inspection came out clean. There are  a couple of items they recommend including new spark plugs and a brake fluid flush.\\This Prius is in great shape. It's an amazing fuel efficient vehicle. This is a great deal for reliable transportation that is also ride share ready. \\Here is a lot of documentation from the dealer. I also paid for an oil change. \\Link to documentation: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Rv7KR6HQuoXOYQtx637m-IQThJ4CXnn/view?usp=sharing    "

At 57k this is a very low mile car. It’s been my fair-weather, Sunday driver. I have another car that I use as a daily driver. \\I’ve owned it for four years and have put 6K miles on it during that time. It’s been meticulously maintained and kept in a heated garage. With the exception of very minor paint dings it looks and runs absolutely brand new. You must see it to believe it.  \\All black leather interior in meticulous condition. Electric everything. Everything works perfectly. Drives like a new car. The tires and rims have around 3k miles on them. I just performed an oil change, replaced the cabin filter and checked all the fluids. The dealer just replaced the air bag and a heater wiring harness that were recalled. It should be good for many miles of trouble free use. \\The only thing that’s been done to the car is the replacement of the rims. I have the original rims and tires as part of the sale if you prefer the stock look.

I have owned the car since 2010 when I bought it at Auburn Subaru with about 12k miles on it.  It's been a great car.  Recently bought a Subaru Forester due to a growing family.

It has been nothing but wonderful to drive. I purchased it at 69k miles back in 2016 and it is currently sitting at 83,400. It is my daily driver so expect the mileage to vary a little. I have modified the vehicle slightly. I added dual cone intakes, a new charge pipe and blow off valve. Cosmetically, I have installed a front and rear spoiler and brand new TSW wheels with PilotSuperSports. The wheels have one been on the car for less than 2k miles. I recently had the car serviced and there is no mechanical issues at all. I have an extended warranty active until April 16th if this year. I am not selling you a lemon, this car drives beautifully. Over the years I have had the Oil Pan replaced, power steering pump replaced and some other smaller things. I have all of the receipts of everything done to the car. For peace of mind, you can take the car to any mechanic and have it inspected. I will take care of any problems with my extended warranty. There are some paint chips on the front of the car and a small scratch on the bottom of the right side skirt due to the wonderful driveways of Mill Creek. CARFAX reports my car at a $10,080 value through private party. Want the car sold by the end of the month before I have to re-register it.

This BMW 535i is an exceptional drive with amazing handling and an impressive twin turbo engine.  I've babied this vehicle and parked it in the garage at work and home.  This is the only 10 year old BMW 535i with only 54,000 miles.  All other cars of similar specs are being sold with over 100,000 and show their wear and tear.  Not this one.  In my opinion, looks like it came out of the showroom yesterday.\\The 5-Series models are athletic and surefooted sport sedans that offer a surprising level of comfort inside. Technology features are also a strong point in the 5-Series, with performance and safety standouts like Active Steering, Active Roll Stabilization and a night vision system.   Sound, navigation systems are great and seat comfort is also fine.\\I purchased this car for one and only one reason - point to point drives from Seattle to Vancouver, BC every 2nd weekend so that I can visit family in Canada.  My two hour drive feels better than first class on Singapore Airlines.  The 6 cylinder drive is so smooth with little to no road noise (in my opinion)\\Before I get to the specs, let me share a CarFax Vehicle report for this car produced December 25, 2018.  Click here:\\https://1drv.ms/b/s!AjyoAoVSH61ko9V7Ugay8X_kCdCHPg\\OK, now with the details\\- Engine: 3.0L I6 F DOHC 24V\- Transmission: Automatic, 6-speed OD Steptronic\- Drive train: Rear Wheel Drive\- Braking: Traction Control, ABS, Dynamic Stability Control\- Steering: Power Steering, Tilt & Telescoping Wheel\- Entertainment: Bluetooth Wireless, CD/MP3, Sirius Satellite\- Comfort: Power Windows, Cruise Control, Air Conditioning \- Security: Anti-Theft, Keyless Entry, Power Door Locks\- Seats: Dual Power Seats; Leather\- Color: Midnight Metallic Black\- Title: CLEAN\\Here's some helpful history of the car\\1.  Only 54,000 miles (approximately 5K miles driven per year!)\2.  I'm the 3rd owner to be graced with this car\3.  The condition is excellent : No corrosion/rust and it has been driven/registered in CA & WA only\4.  I've got all the maintenance records; meticulously documented and collected from previous owners\\Here's where it gets better.  This is NO base model.  The included packages and options are insane!  They include:\\- Premium package\- Sports package\- Navigation options\\Details on each package are shown below\\PREMIUM PACKAGE\------------------------------\- Universal Garage Door Opener\- Auto-dimming interior and exterior mirrors\- Auto-dimming rearview mirror\- Ambient light package Sport suspension \- Active Roll Stabilization (ARS) \\SPORTS PACKAGE \----------------------------\- Sports leather steering wheel \- Space-saver spare \- Shadowline trim \- Multi-Contour seats \- 18"" Light-alloy wheels \- Star Spoke with mixed performance run-flat tires\- Sport automatic transmission with shift paddles \\ADD ON FEATURES\-------------------------\- Navigation system \- iPod and USB adapter\- Fog Lights\\Why am I selling?  I have a new obligation requiring daily driving from the east side to Seattle so like many, I've bitten the HYBRID bug and want a gas performing vehicle.  I'm talking Prius or the equivalent people!  Yes, it's a downgrade but I haven't the need for 2 luxury vehicles in the same family.  So my loss is your gain.\\This gem of a vehicle is offered to all Craigslist readers for the fair price of:\\$11,800\\That is precisely in the middle of its Kelly Blue Book value.  In fact, this car is priced approximately $1,200 below the high end of the private party value range for the condition of this car.\\See the Kelly Blue Book Calculation here\https://1drv.ms/u/s!AjyoAoVSH61ko9V8_9MwDnP50s4N3g\\What's been added, changed, or fixed?  Everything :)  It's no secret, the BMW forums report oil leaks from the oil filter housing gaskets.  Mine wasn't serious but I took care of it right away.  Why?  I get my car serviced from a BMW master mechanic who suggested the recommendations and avoid larger problems if/when they happened.  This was recently fixed in March for the sum of $1,500.  While I was at it, I also had the (a) drive belt/tensioner and (b) front crank seal replaced.  Of course, had the classic oil changes as well.\\Before my time, the following was done:\1. Window tinting\2. Performance Times ($1,004)\3. Brake Fluid Service ($746)\4. Brake Front/Rear ($1,115)\5. Fuel Pump and Sensor Replacement ($5,44)\\...with records to show.\\I'm not in a huge rush to sell this car.  I love it and with summer coming, this could be my year of US-to-Canada luxury drive experiences.  But if it sells, I'm a step closer to satisfying my objectives steering me to a Prius (or equivalent).  \\In my opinion, this is an awesome car with a great ride.

This car is great!  If you're looking for something fun, flexible, super efficient with plenty of get-up-and-go, this is your car. I'm the 2nd owner and I've treated this car like my baby. It's got a newer 12v battery and brand new run-flat tires from Costco. Regular oil changes at the dealer or done by me. Always kept clean and ready to roll.\\This car has every option available for this model year. Backup camera, parking sensors, power liftgate, panoramic roof, leather interior, integrated touchscreen, heated seats, voice activation, navigation, automatic windshield wipers, automatic dimming rear view mirror, etc, etc.  The 60/40 fold down rear seats open up the cargo area for a lot of hauling room, and the front bucket seats offer comfort and (for the driver) power adjustments in all sorts of directions. \\Never been smoked in.\\The dual powerplant gives the car plenty of horsepower to accelerate into traffic. It can go up to 20 miles on electric power alone (that varies with conditions). The charging cord is included and plugs into a standard electrical outlet.  Depending on my driving I have gone over 1000 miles on a tank of gas. More typical is 500 - 800 before needing to refuel. \\Selling because I bought myself a Cadillac for my birthday, so I need to make space in my garage.  Otherwise, I would have kept this car for years.\\This would be a great car for Uber/Lyft drivers. Rear seat headroom is vastly superior to any other rideshare car out there - I'm 6'2"" and easily fit into the back seats (unlike a Prius or any slope-backed sedan out there).\\She's ready to go. Clean title in hand. Price is negotiable, but not much. Test drives to those with proof of funds and a sincere interest. \\Scammers hoping I'll ship it to you or cash your check can bite me.

They said the suggested services were to change transmission fluid, change power steering fluid, and that the front passenger side strut is loose and should eventually be replaced.\\All other issues are only cosmetic: several dents and dings on the exterior, the tire pressure sensor is broken so the tire warning light is always on, and the 6 CD changer is broken, so it doesn't play CD's (the radio still works), and it clicks every time the car is started (the 6 CD changer is trying to switch between CDs, but fails, so it makes a clicking noise for about 30 seconds when the car starts. This would be easily fixed by installing any new stereo system, but the clicking never bothered me enough to do it).\\It's only been in 1 very minor accident, where someone bumped into the front passenger side. There was no structural damage; only a replaced the headlight and bumper.\\These minor issues aside, the car is in excellent condition and runs as well as it did the day I bought it.

Bluetooth works well. It is a reliable smaller commuter car and although I don't recommend it as a family car if you have more than 2 kids, it can hold up to 5 people with seatbelts. And it's perfect for current ride-share drivers too. \\The rear bumper has some larger scratches that I covered up with factory paint. The front bumper and the lower sides have smaller scratches. Driver door has a barely detectable small dent, passenger door has tiny scratches. The wiper blades motor might need replacing down the line - especially if driving in snow and ice.
