She has served me well over the years back and forth to see my family in Spokane and to and from Highline and Bellevue Colleges. But I got a job downtown and walk to work now; I can't justify paying for insurance and parking anymore. \\The car has some cosmetic dings on it, but it runs great and has low mileage. I posed a pic of the biggest flaw which is a crack in the front bumper cover.  There are some scratches and small dents from parking up on Capitol Hill. I took pictures of every side, but I don't want anyone to be surprised if you come see it. After all, it is a used car I'm selling and you might be buying. \\Oil was always changed on time and is good for a few more thousand miles (see sticker). No known issues so it should be good for 100,000+ miles. Tires and brakes should serve you well for a while also, Kiki is ready for the next Commuter/Student/Uber driver/Liver-of-Life!\\Let me know if you have any questions.

Now that I have purchased my dream car, I need to find this one a good home. \\The brakes need replacing immediately. I just spent $400-500 on ""replacing"" them last year, but have since found out that the shop who worked on the brakes was run by cheaters/scammers and went out of business (https://www.yelp.com/biz/specialty-auto-care-seattle). I went there because they had a Groupon for an oil change and they convinced me I needed them to replace my brakes ASAP, that it wouldn't even be safe for me to drive home. I learned a hard lesson about asking for a second opinion!\One headlight also needs to be replaced, but the rest of the work it “needs” is optional.\It does have some cosmetic damage that I have not fixed due to cost: think of it as pre-dented so you can park anywhere in Seattle without worrying about someone denting it! I have included clear close-up photos of all damage. \\This is a very reliable car that is relatively cheap to maintain/repair, it gets decent gas mileage and has tons of room for both passengers and cargo. The trunk is so large that I have been able to move apartments many times just using this car instead of renting a truck. It has plenty of life left for someone who is willing to invest a little time and money. \\2008 Malibus go for ~$7.5k on Kelley Blue Book. With at least $1000 of repairs needed, I figured it’s best to ask for a sale price of $3000. I am open to negotiation. \I am willing to take cash or work with you to get an auto loan. I just purchased a car earlier this month from a Craigslist seller using an auto loan from BECU so I am familiar with the process. \\If interested, please email me to set up a test drive. \\\",https://images.craigslist.org/00H0H_iKFyJdwyYY8_600x450.jpg

Has since been fixed with no structural damage. \\What to expect when you inspect the vehicle\- The steering wheel lock that I’ve used whenever visiting my parents has scratched up the wheel in an isolated area. Everything works, just some scratches are present. \- This car has been parked in the city meaning there are little dings and scratches on the paint here or there. \- Rims also have some slight damage from parallel parking (should be included in photos)\\Honda Civic, VW Jetta, Volkswagen Jetta, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra, Chevy Cruze, Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, Ford Fiesta, Hyundai Sonata, Honda Fit, Mazda 3, Scion TC, Honda Accord, Subaru Legacy, Mazda 2, Chevy Spark, Hyundai Accent\\",https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_5LHMWdEIulw_600x450.jpg

The brakes have been upgraded to larger slotted discs with Red Stuff Ceramic pads. It stops on a dime. It also has Dolby Surround premium sound with both USB and AUX inputs in the console, and WeatherGuard custom floor pan inserts. The interior is completed with the R Design leather package and sunroof. All of the windows are tinted and are in great condition. The driving lights up front are a deep blue and accent the car's silver paint very well. This thing is a head turner!\\I find the engine to be even more ""spirited"" than I expected from what is supposed to be a 225hp turbo 5 cylinder. It has a ton of get-up-and-go! The suspension also seems set up for performance. The suspension has had a few recent parts replaced including two struts in the front. One of them was replaced before we owned the car and the other more recently with genuine Volvo parts. The rest of the suspension seems sound and some time spent under the car while it was in the shop  showed it was in good shape below. That being said, I can't vouch for the strut that was replaced earlier as it was from an off brand company. We do have all of the records of what we did with the car. It has been serviced by some of the best in the area including DaisyWagen and All Volvo service in Ballard. \\It's amazing to drive and fun on the road. It's got an ""AutoManual"" transmission so you can shift it when you like or leave it up to the computer for ease of use in the city. Either way it's a blast and will turn your commute into fun even if you're stuck in traffic.\\I have a VIN report for this vehicle and it can be furnished if needed.

It’s a great vehicle and we hate to see it go.  We moved to Seattle recently and have finally accepted that we have no need for two vehicles.  This vehicle has been very reliable with only routine maintenance (brakes, battery, tires, fluids, filters, etc.) needed throughout its life. The current set of tires (Bridgestone) was installed approximately 20,000 miles ago and has lots of life left in them with no patches or plugs.  One of the tire pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS) needs to be replaced, but that is only a slight annoyance seeing the light on the dash.  All tires hold air and have never lost pressure.  The interior and exterior are what you would expect out of a ten-year-old vehicle with slight imperfections.  All exterior paint chips/scratches have been touched up with Lexus factory touch-up paint and are unnoticeable unless you are searching for them.  The dash is starting to crack near the passenger air vent and the carpet has a few stains that could probably be removed by a professional.  The seats are in great shape with no rips/tears/cracks.

If you are looking to drive for Uber/Lift on the side, you will be interested to know that he drove this car for Uber as recently as December. The car has a rear video camera, and a touch screen system. \\I drove the Prius recently from San Diego to Seattle with no issues, often averaging around 50 MPG. A few weeks after I arrived in Seattle the car lost power when I parked even though I had been driving for more than an hour. A jump start resolved the issue, but it happened again a couple of times. I discovered the root cause - a water leak in the rear, directly leaking water onto an aftermarket 12 volt battery. \\Well, $1400 later, the leak has been fixed and a new OEM 12 volt battery installed. The car is running great now. I also paid a Toyota for a 154 point Buyer's Inspection that you can find in the documentation below. The inspection came out clean. There are  a couple of items they recommend including new spark plugs and a brake fluid flush.\\This Prius is in great shape. It's an amazing fuel efficient vehicle. This is a great deal for reliable transportation that is also ride share ready. \\Here is a lot of documentation from the dealer.
