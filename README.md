# new-used-car
A lil' craigslist scrape, inspired by [@rileypredum](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-craigslist-a-complete-tutorial-c41cea4f4981).
The gist: We were in a car accident (everyone is fine!), the car was totaled, and then we found ourselves on craigslist. The main problem with hunting for used cars on craigslist is that most folks don't post their vehicles' fuel economy ratings. This scraper joins in an [EPA dataset](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) and offers a first-order approximation of city, highway, and combined MPG.
I port the resulting csv over to Tableau for filtering and visualization.

### Update: Success!
